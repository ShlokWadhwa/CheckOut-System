Read me before running the attached program files!

Welcome to the Kitchen Supply Inventory System Prototype.
We will go step by step in this file to set you up with the functionality.

Open all the files in PyCharmCE and run the kitchen_supply.py file from the folder.

Step 1:
When you first open the file, none of the products or customers will be visible, we will do this using the ‘Open’ option in the menu.
Using the menu, click ‘file’ on the Menu bar and from the drop down list choose the ‘Open Customer and ‘Open Products’ options.
When you click on these buttons, they will open the files to import the customers and products, and will also show you confirmation messages once the customers and products have loaded.

Step 2: 
At this point we will use a customers account to purchase products. 
From the listbox of customers select anyone with a positive balance as the users with a negative balance are employees. 
Once you select a customer profile, double click on the product you would like to see information about. This will automatically populate the boxes below the products listbox and let you view information about products. 
If you would like to delete items from your cart, you can specify how many items you would like deleted and then hit the delete button. You need to make sure to have selected the item you would like to delete and also mention how many items you want to delete.
If you forgot how many items you had added, simply double click and all the information shows up.
If you would like to add this product to your cart, you can specify how many of the items you would like to buy and hit the ‘Add’ button that shows up when you view your item.
 
*** For Employees only ***
If you have an employee account and would like to add/edit information about any product, after following the above steps, your button will change to an ‘Edit’ button which will change the information of a product. 
In order to successfully change the information of a product you will need to enter the Employee Pin (2233) in the Pin text-box, and hit edit. This will change the information about the product and update it to the listbox as well.

Step 3:
Once you have selected all the items you would like to buy in the cart, you need to enter your PIN. If your pin is not verifiable, it tells you that the entered pin is wrong and then you can try to buy your products again using the right pin.
If your PIN was successfully entered, it displays a message stating that your purchase was successful and that an invoice has been generated.

Step 4:
At this point, if you would like to save the data in the file, you can click the ‘File’ option on your menu bar and click ‘Save Customer’ to save customer data and ‘Save Product’ to save product data in order to maintain persistence of data.

***Note to Employees***
If you would like to add or delete products to the product listbox, you can switch to the Employee mode on from the file drop down on the menu. If you would like to add a new product, you can enter the required information in the text-boxes and hit the Add Product button to add the product to the list. Once you are done adding a product, you can save to write your file.
There also is a Delete Product function available, which lets you delete products from the listbox directly. All you need to do is select an item and delete it.
You can also edit the item details in the Employee mode just like how you did in the Customer mode(described above). Do not forget to verify your pin before selecting any of the buttons!
At any point in the program, you can switch back the Customer Mode using the same menu drop down provided.
It will go back to how the program begins, giving all the options needed for the customers.

Step 5:
Make any other transactions you like and once you have made all the transactions, make sure to save the data using the file menu drop downs. 
Once you have saved all your data, you can exit from the document using the exit function in the menu drop down as well. 

When you re-launch the program, it will be fresh as new, and you will have to start with the same process of opening both the files, but this time the files will be different due to the transactions from before.

Have fun using the program!!
